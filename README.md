# Simple TPC Client-Server Echo Communcation

*** This is a Simple Data Communcation Project created by Tate Swidorski in SUMMER SEMESTER 2025 ***

The assignment was to create a server and a client that used TCP. The project specified that I would 
create a client that takes input from the user and sends it to server. When the server recieves the 
message it replies back with the same message but in reverse.
